# Chetor Article Scraper for KeyPhraseExtraction Evaluation

This project focuses on scraping general articles from [chetor.com](https://chetor.com), a renowned platform for self-development, hobbies, and learning. Once the articles are scraped, they undergo preprocessing and cleaning to ensure they are fit for testing the "KeyPhraseExtraction" module provided by [CICAP.ir](https://cicap.ir). This evaluation allows users to understand the accuracy of the KeyPhraseExtraction module on real-world Persian articles.
